### DIRECTORY: template/

This is ``template/`` directory which contains several template files used to
create new source files from. See ``HOWTO/create-source.md`` to read more about
source file creation.

Files are used to create new sources by hand (by copying the file to a
desired location and changing its name). There is a list of such templates:

  - ``file.md`` - to create new markdown documents, such as ``README.md``,
  - ``LICENSE`` - plain template of license text,
  - ``license.cpp`` - license text as a C++ comment,
  - ``license.py`` - license text as a python comment,
  - ``unit.cpp`` - template of C++ source file,
  - ``unit.hpp`` - template of C++ header file,
