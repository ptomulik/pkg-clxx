Description: C++ library for object-oriented OpenCL programming
 Clxx is a C++ library which exposes OpenCL's functionality in an
 object-oriented way. Its goal is to simplify usage of the OpenCL functions
 by providing type-safe and easy to use interface.
 .
 Clxx is not just a set of bare wrappers around OpenCL calls. In addition to
 several objects and functions provided for accessing the OpenCL
 functionality, it also implements additional facilities such as specialized
 I/O functions, serialization, swig-based wrappers to access clxx from
 scripting languages (Python), and even ready-to use applications such as
 clxx-clinfo or clxx-clcc.
 .
 This package contains header files used by several other parts of clxxx.
